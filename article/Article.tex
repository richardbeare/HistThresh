% The abstract should be a paragraph or two long, and describe the
% scope of the document.
Using intensity histograms to estimate image thresholds is a long
established practice in image processing and image analysis and a wide
variety of techniques have been developed. Different techniques are
appropriate for different intensity distributions. This article
implements a number of standard techniques not currently available in
ITK.

\section{Introduction}
This contribution includes classes for threshold estimation using the
following methods: Huang\cite{huang1995image},
Intermodes\cite{prewitt1965analysis},
Minimum\cite{prewitt1965analysis}, IsoData\cite{ridler1978picture},
Li\cite{li1993minimum,li1998iterative}, MaxEntropy\cite{kapur1985new},
KittlerIllingworth\cite{kittler1986minimum},
Moments\cite{tsai1985moment}, Yen\cite{yen1995new},
RenyiEntropy\cite{kapur1985new},
Shanbhag\cite{shanbhag1994utilization} and
Triangle\cite{zack1977automatic}.

All classes are largely derived from the AutoThresh
\cite{LandiniImageJ} package for ImageJ. The brief outline below is
taken from the presentation associated with the
HistThresh\cite{HistThreshMatlab} matlab toolbox, which was also a
source of information for the AutoThresh package. The exception is the
triangle method, that was written before discovery of the AutoThresh
packge and before this project got slightly out of hand.

\section{Thresholding algorithms}
The histogram of the standard cthead image, and the thresholds
estimated by the various methods are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cthead}
and \ref{fig:thresh}
\subsection{Huang}
\subsection{Intermodes}
Iteratively smooths histogram until only 2 peaks remain. Threshold is
the midpoint of the two peaks. Not good for histograms with very
unequal peaks.
\subsection{Minimum}
Same as Intermodes, except that threshold is the mimimum point between
the peaks, rather than midway. This method is part of the {\em
  itkIntermodeThresholdImageFilter} and is selected using the
{\em UseIntermodeOff} method.
\subsection{IsoData}

\subsection{Li}
\subsection{MaxEntropy}

\subsection{KittlerIllingworth}
\subsection{Moments}
Choose threshold such that the binary image has the same first three moments as the grey level image.
\subsection{Yen}
\subsection{RenyiEntropy}
\subsection{Shanbhag}
\subsection{Triangle}


\section{Future improvements}
All classes in this package were based on the existing ITK
implementation of the Otsu method. This class does not make use of the
rich ITK histogram structure, and hence the new classes do not utilize
it either. There is also a moderate amount of repeated code between
the different filter and calculator classes. Future work should look
at refactoring the classes and making better use of the ITK histogram
tools.
